/**
 * This class is a log stream watcher, that is, an object that is watching a stream, waiting for changes on it.
 * It is an event emitter, that emit 'log' events when new log entries are written to the file.
 * Log entries are matched against the provided pattern so the 'log' event will have an object
 * It also emit 'error' events when some error happen.
 *
 * @param stream
 * @param pattern RegExp against which each new log entry will be matched to extract the log fields
 * @param fieldNames Array of field names used to build the object emitted by the 'log' event,
 *               using the values gathered from matching the pattern against a log entry
 * @param opts Supported values:
 *               - autoStart: If true, the log watcher start watching the log file immediately
 *               - allowPatternViolations (defaults to false): If true, log entries not matching the pattern will not
 *                   emit an error, but will be added to the previous log entry. Useful to support logs
 *                   with stacktraces, and any other kink of dump.
 *               - retainedLogTimeout: Timeout no emit a log that has been retained just in case it were not a
 *                   complete log (because the last change in the log file could be part of this log)
